# Brady Bunch the Rescue's Boneyard
## About the Game 

Brady's favorite thing is a good bone. And he loves to run. Help Brady move to collect as many bones as he can. He also loves to find and chew on objects that aren't great for him. Help him stay away from those. 

## Tech Stack
- HTML - Possibly with use of Canvas
- CSS - I intend to incorporate Tailwind CSS where I can. 
- Javascript
## MVP
- Create background of a field.
- Create character of dog.
